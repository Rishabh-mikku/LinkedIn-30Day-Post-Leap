ğŸ”¹ Arrays: A collection of elements stored in a contiguous memory location. 
ğŸ”¹ Linked Lists: A linear data structure where each element is connected to the next one through pointers. 
ğŸ”¹ Stacks: A data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. 
ğŸ”¹ Queues: A data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. 
ğŸ”¹ Trees: A hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes. 
ğŸ”¹ Graphs: A non-linear data structure with nodes connected through edges. 

ğŸ“š Each data structure has its own advantages and use cases, so make sure to choose the right one for your project. #DataStructures #TechTalk #DataManagement
